To buid the project you will need Android Studio (http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/studio.html).
There is no need for separate views, they where just implemented like this because the code pieces were stitched together in one night.
Also the email and note fields need to be implemented and a naming pattern has to be decided, so that each uploaded file has a unique id.
